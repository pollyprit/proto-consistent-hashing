# Consistent Hashing
#### This simulates a consistent hashing mechanism with nodes and keys. Nodes can be added or removed, and keys are redistributed accordingly. The hash function used is a simple modulo operation for demonstration purposes. The program supports commands to add/remove nodes, add keys, and display the current state.
